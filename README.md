# FutureActivities Customer Orders

This extension will create the following Magento REST API endpoint:

    /rest/V1/orders/mine
    
Which will return an array of all the orders placed by the authorized customer.

Hopefully this extension won't be needed for long as this endpoint should be built
into the API by default.
